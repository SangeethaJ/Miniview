Miniview
========

A Jquery plugin to create a miniview (mapper) of the container with supplied nodes (children) in it.

The plugin requires to have an element with id "miniview" with width and height of your preference. This is the element that is going to show the miniview.

Usage: $(wrapper).miniview(nodes);
where wrapper is the container/parent element and nodes are the children of the container that needs to be miniviewed.

Please look at demo.html to view a sample of what it does.

This is just very early alpha release. There  might be lots of rooms for improvements.
Please feel free to fork and contribute.
